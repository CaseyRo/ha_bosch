## Open Loops

[15:42] Promoted to open-loops.md: Playwright may be blocked by Bosch; also `en-us` locale hardcoded in auth URL but account is EU — might be hitting wrong regional instance. Try `de-de` locale. ^tr4a9c2e81b7

## Notes

[15:45] Password reset via `en-us` URL also failed — confirms account is not on the US SingleKey ID instance. Account is EU (Berlin). Open loop updated.

[15:40] PoinTTAPI OAuth Playwright automation attempts: Built `test_pointtapi_playwright.py` to automate Bosch SingleKey ID login via Playwright and capture the OAuth callback URL. Iteratively fixed: (1) email field selector (`UserIdentifierInput.EmailInput.StringValue`), (2) two-step form requiring "CONTINUE" click before password field appears, (3) password fill not working. Eventually abandoned full automation — switched to semi-automated mode where browser opens and user logs in manually, script captures callback after. Also built `run_playwright.sh` + `.env` (BOSCH_DEVICE_ID only) + `POINTTAPI_OAUTH_TESTING.md`. Suspicion: Bosch/SingleKey ID may be detecting and blocking Playwright (headless browser fingerprint) — could explain why password fill silently fails or login is rejected even with correct credentials.
